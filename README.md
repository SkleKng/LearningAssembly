# LearningAssembly

I woke up one day and decided I wanted to learn assembly. This is me learning assembly.

To compile:

```bash
ml /c /coff [input].asm
link /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE [input].obj # currently just sticking to command line scripts, might move to graphical scripts later
[input].exe
```

Requires MASM obviously
